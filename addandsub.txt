'''
we have 3 numbers X Y and Z and we are gonna add X+Y and subtract that value with Z
'''

START: LXI H,2100H #initialize memory pointer in H register
MOV A,M #move the value in memory to Accumulator(Here M stands for HL pair)
INX H #move the memory pointer to next address
MOV B,M #move the pointed data to B
INX H #memory pointer to next address
MOV C,M #move the pointed data to C register
ADD B #gives A=A+B we are doing this for adding X and Y
SUB C #Subtract the given value by A=A-C now we are subtracting Z from X+Y
INX H #increase memory pointer to store the results
MOV M,A #The accumulator data given to the memory pointer
END:HLT #end the program
